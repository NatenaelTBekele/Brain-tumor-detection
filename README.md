# Healthcare-AI
* Deep learning has been proven to be superior in detecting diseases from X-rays, MRI scans and CT scans which could significantly improve the speed and accuracy of diagnosis.
* Artificial Intelligence is revolutionizing Healthcare in many areas such as:
* Disease Diagnosis with medical imaging
* Surgical Robots
* Maximizing Hospital Efficiency
* In this case study, we will assume that you work as an AI/ML consultant and you have been hired by a medical diagnosis company in NYC.
* You have been tasked to improve the speed and accuracy of detecting and localizing brain tumors based on MRI scans.
* This would drastically reduce the cost of cancer diagnosis & help in early diagnosis of tumors which would essentially be a life saver.
* The team has collected brain MRI scans and have approached you to develop a model that could detect and localize tumors.
* You have been provided with 3929 Brain MRI scans along with their brain tumour location.
